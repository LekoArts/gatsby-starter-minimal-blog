<h2 id="enterthematrix">Enter the Matrix</h2>
<a href="https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/">Brendan</a> produced a <a href="https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/enter-the-matrix/">really, really informative article introducing Matrix</a>. As someone who is still very new to the project I found this writng to be very clear and informative, so thank you! The article made it to the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17063761">top of Hacker News</a>, where you can find a discussion of both the article and Matrix itself.
<h2 id="presentationaboutmatrix">Presentation about Matrix</h2>
<a href="https://twitter.com/martinkrafft">martinkrafft</a> presented about Matrix at <a href="https://wossat.nz/">wossat</a> a New Zealand Open Source show and tell meetup. His talk <a href="https://twitter.com/wossat/status/997230578385612801">can be seen here</a>, and focuses on the benefits of Matrix for users.
<h1 id="specproposals">Spec Proposals</h1>
As you may have seen from the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/05/17/introducing-matrix-specification-changes/">previous blog post</a>, we have a new drive to advance the Matrix Specification itself. Part of this is <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals</a>, which lists all the spec change proposals we've accumulated so far, and describes the flow for getting new proposals merged. There is a new room, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org">#matrix-spec:matrix.org</a> for discussion, please join if you want to get involved in this process. Check out the page and the blog post for more detail.

Next up: try to turn some of the many WIP proposals into Spec PRs...
<h1 id="fractalhackfest2018">Fractal Hackfest 2018</h1>
<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/Fractal2018">Fractal Hackfest 2018</a>: was super successful and productive by all accounts, and there were many! Check out reports from Daniel García Moreno (<a href="http://danigm.net/fractal-hackfest1.html">Day 1</a>, <a href="http://danigm.net/fractal-hackfest2.html">Day 2</a>), <a href="https://eishagsoc.wordpress.com/2018/05/13/fractal-hackfest.html">Eisha Chen-yen-su</a>, <a href="http://bytesgnomeschozo.blogspot.com/2018/05/fracturing-fractal.html">Adrien Plazas</a>, <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2018/05/15/fractal-hackfest-2018/">Julian Sparber</a>, <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2018/05/16/fractal-hackfest-in-strasbourg/">Tobias Bernard</a> and <a href="https://www.alexandrefranke.com/blog/20180518-Fractal-hackfest/">Alexandre Franke</a>.

A major topic at the Hackfest was a discussion of splitting the Fractal client into two UIs for the different behaviours of messaging apps. For anyone interested in product design thinking this is a genuinely fascinating topic. I encourage you to read <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2018/05/16/banquets-and-barbecues/">"Banquets and Barbecues", Tobias' excellent coverage</a> of the latest thinking. The different chat personas are very well explained and the post brings up some of the immediate technical challenges too.

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> reports on <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">mxisd</a>, a Federated Matrix Identity server for self-hosted Matrix infrastructures:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.1-rc.1">mxisd v1.1 RC1</a> is out, addressing various privacy issues and being more GDPR-friendly overall. Testing and feedback from the community is very much appreciated</blockquote>
<h2 id="dimension">Dimension</h2>

Go try it out in the test room <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#test-doge-bot-crom:matrix.org">#test-doge-bot-crom:matrix.org</a>.
<h1 id="communityclientserverinteractions">Independent Client-Server interactions</h1>
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/construct-gomuks.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3220 size-full" src="https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/construct-gomuks.jpeg" alt="" width="900" height="732" /></a>
<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/mxhsd-fractal.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3219 size-full" src="https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/mxhsd-fractal.png" alt="" width="912" height="749" /></a> 
Lots of excitement at the variety of independent clients and servers able to interact over the matrix protocol. The images above show <a href="https://github.com/jevolk/charybdis">The Construct</a> (server) and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/gomuks">gomuks</a> (client), and then <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a> and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a>. A fundamental part of matrix is to be an open protocol, so it's great to see entirely independent implementations liaising together! While implementing <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a>, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has been documenting spec omissions <a href="https://kamax.io/matrix/api/client_server/unstable.html">in a branch of the spec</a> - we're hoping he will contribute these back!

Honourable mention for <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mujx:matrix.org">mujx</a>, who was sending messages with <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">Ruma</a> a year ago!
<h1 id="matrixcoreteamexpansion">Matrix Core team expansion</h1>
<ul>
 	<li>Stève - 17th May (yesterday)</li>
 	<li>Amber - 21st (Monday)</li>
 	<li>Anoa - 21st (Monday)</li>
 	<li>Hubert - 28th May</li>
 	<li>Half-Shot - 4th June
...and one more community member, hopefully (just sorting paperwork currently!)</li>
</ul>
Heads up that we're consciously trying to hire a mix of folks from the Matrix community as well as those outside it - and avoid hiring the whole community, both to ensure diversity of viewpoint &amp; experience in the core team, and also to avoid cannibalising folks who working on their own commercial projects on top of Matrix. We'd prefer Matrix to be as decentralised and heterogenous as possible, needless to say - and instead try to support folks in building on Matrix without hiring them into the core team (where we'd expect them to focus on the core project for everyone's benefit). This may change once we have Matrix set up as a separate foundation, once we've got out of beta, of course.

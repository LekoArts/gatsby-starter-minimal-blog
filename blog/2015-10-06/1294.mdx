A weekend of intense prototyping and hacking at <a href="http://tadhack.com/2015/tadhack-mini-chicago/">TADHack-mini Chicago</a> is over, and we were very happy to again see some really interesting projects using Matrix!

Team 'Vivo' - Nestor Bermudez and Arin Sime - used Matrix, Tropo, and Telestax to create an Apple Watch app that notifies your loved ones when you are having a heart attack. Find <a href="https://webrtc.ventures/2015/10/apple-watch-heart-rate-monitor/">more information here</a> - and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYrbKSgAZZI">a recording of their presentation here</a>. This project won the Telestax prize.

Charles Solar and Jiang Shuyang used Matrix and Flowroute resources for a platform independent app called 'Samaritan' which allows users to post help requests like "I got a flat tire!" or "My computer crashed!". Others can then call / text / video chat with them to solve their problem. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTcbFaAPArY">A video of their presentation can be seen here</a>. This hack won the Flowroute prize.

Vladimir Beloborodov demoed his award-winning Matrix-hack from <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/2014/12/24/matrix-wins-best-innovation-award-at-webrtc-paris/">WebRTC Paris</a>: using Matrix just to set up a WebRTC connection between his iPad and robot, thus proving that you can have a robot with telepresence functions without having to depend on a remote server - see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jq2vzavYiBI">his demo here</a>.

Adnan Baleh, Caterina Lazaro, Javier Garcia, Ernesto G. Grabwosky, Sergio Gil and Marion Le Callonnec - Team 'ProbatioNerds' - created a mobile Matrix app to control the provided <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/HR-OS1">Trossen Robotics HR-OS1 Humanoid Endoskeleton robot</a> over the Internet - even making it dance the Macarena! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCv8dfbwr88">Presentation video can be seen here</a>. We awarded team 'ProbatioNerds' the TADHack Matrix prize - an HR-OS1 - and we hope the team and the robot will keep learning new tricks and moves!

We keep being impressed by the quality of projects developed at TADHacks - remember, in practice you only have around 12 hours to work on your hack. Congrats to all who participated - and thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/Alan_Quayle">Alan</a> for arranging it!

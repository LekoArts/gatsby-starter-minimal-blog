<h2 id="fractalhackfest">Fractal Hackfest</h2>
Developers and creators of <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a>, the GNOME Matrix client, have been holding a <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/FractalDecember2018">Hackfest this week in Seville</a>. Matthew and I caught up with them on video for Matrix Live this week, and discussed the product improvements they've been making and their plans for the next release (due next week!)

<h2 id="thisweekinruma">This Week in Ruma</h2>
We don't often get to feature news from <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">Ruma</a>, but this week there is an updated <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2018-12-09/">This Week in Ruma</a>.
<blockquote>Ruma is not dead, however, and small improvements have continued over the last year. The Matrix spec has advanced quite a bit and many of the blocking issues for Ruma have been resolved. Rust's maturity is another story. async/await is still under development and this is the most significant blocking issue to progress on Ruma.</blockquote>
<h2 id="maubotnewtooling">maubot new tooling</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working on tooling for <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a>:
<blockquote>maubot got a command-line tool for building plugins and managing maubot instances. I also added some server-side stuff for easy registration of accounts in the management interface using synapse shared secrets, but the UI for that isn't ready.
Also, I'm planning on adding some kind of small Matrix client in the management interface for manually managing the added bot clients. That might lead to a separate library that could be used in other projects or embedded in websites.</blockquote>
<h2 id="mxisdv121releasedupdatingrecommended">mxisd v1.2.1 released, updating recommended</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> with a new release of <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a>:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a> hits <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.1">v1.2.1</a> with a new maintenance release, fixing bugs and regressions from v1.2.0. Updating to v1.2.1 is strongly encouraged as v1.3.x will contain breaking changes and will not be a straight-forward update like v1.x has been until now.</blockquote>
<h2 id="clients">Clients</h2>
<h3 id="lazyloadinglandsinqmatrixclient">Lazy-loading lands in QMatrixClient</h3>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has reported that lazy-loading, a Matrix feature that entails only loading room member details as needed, is now in <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> master.
<blockquote>reference implementation in Quaternion will follow up</blockquote>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> has been testing the feature in <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/spectral">Spectral</a>, which uses the library, and says there is a 30%-50% reduction in RAM usage at startup.

I aim to have it over by the end of the year, or the very early days of 2019 at the latest. Folks can track its progress through <a href="https://cloud.abolivier.bzh/index.php/s/qXi2KFjCQk2c6eG">https://cloud.abolivier.bzh/index.php/s/qXi2KFjCQk2c6eG</a></blockquote>

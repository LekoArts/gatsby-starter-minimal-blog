<h2>TADHack Global 2017</h2>
At the end of September, TADHack Global was held where almost 150 teams spent their weekends hacking towards the $45k total prize money up for grabs. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lb:ldbco.de">Luke</a> spent the final day of the hack talking to teams hacking at IDEALondon in Shoreditch, meeting a few Matrix enthusiasts and long-time collaborators.

Out of 10 hacks, 2 of 4 local winners won prizes locally and went on to be <a href="http://blog.tadhack.com/2017/10/02/tadhack-global-2017-winners/">global winners </a>alongside 6 other teams using Matrix as part of their hacks. Checkout the <a href="http://blog.tadhack.com/2017/10/03/tadhack-london-2017/">TADHack London Wrap-up</a> for details on all of the awesome hacks, especially <a href="https://github.com/aviraldg">Aviral Dasgupta</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOmhgSNS_6E&amp;feature=youtu.be">Pushtime</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/qOYdDyRlDNE" target="_blank">Polite.ai</a>.

Well done to everyone who took part, and a special thanks to those flying Matrix :)
<h2>THE Port 2017</h2>
The following weekend was THE Port 2017, a humanitarian-themed hackathon held at CERN, Geneva in Switzerland. Among the 7 teams participating, the Matrix team consisted of a few software developers from <a href="https://bity.com">Bity</a> including Matrix enthusiast <a href="https://github.com/OmeGak">Alejandro Avilés</a> (who very kindly helped us get a team into the hackathon). <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lb:ldbco.de">Luke</a> and <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dbkr:matrix.org">Dave</a> from the Matrix London office also flew out to help the cause and by the end had a very stable, working prototype by the end of the competition.

The hack we made was a communications system backed by Matrix for use in refugee camps, an idea that hatched at the start of the hackathon (whereas the other projects were well established ideas up to 6 weeks before the event). Check out <a href="https://github.com/theport2017-matrix">the code on GitHub</a> if you're interested in the client-side apps we made over the weekend.

It was another fun weekend for the Matrix team and we look forward to the next one. Stay tuned for updates on upcoming Matrix events!

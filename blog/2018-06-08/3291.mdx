Folks,

v0.31.1 fixes a security bug in the ``get_missing_events`` federation API where event visibility rules were not applied correctly.

We are not aware of it being actively exploited but please upgrade asap.

Sorry for the inconvenience, Synapse and the Matrix spec are still in beta and we still ironing out gaps such as this one.

You can get the release <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.31.1">here</a>.

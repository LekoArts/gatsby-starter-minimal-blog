Hi folks,

On October 19th (next Thursday, as of the time of writing) we're going to be back in Berlin for various meetings - and we're incredibly excited that <a href="http://blueyard.com/">BlueYard</a> have offered to host the world's first ever official <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/matrix-and-friends-tickets-38729041606">Matrix and Decentralised Communications Meetup</a> at their offices in Kreuzberg!  Matthew, Amandine and maybe others will be attending and speaking from the core team, and giving a VIP tour of the long-long-long-awaited Groups/Communities features in Matrix and Riot as well as some of the other good stuff in the pipeline - and we're also excited to have Exul joining us from the community to talk about his recent <a href="https://github.com/exul/matrix-rocketchat">Matrix&lt;-&gt;Rocket.Chat</a> bridging adventures.  We're also expecting some exciting folks to join us from the Ethereum community to talk about decentralised realtime comms in their ecosystem - plus if anyone wants to talk about other Matrix/XMPP/Tox/Briar/Richochet or similar projects please ping us and let us know asap!

<b>Update: we're excited to announce that <a href="https://twitter.com/jFransham">Jack Fransham</a> from <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> (who are <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#polkadot-watercooler:matrix.org">very active</a> Riot/Matrix users - and just raised >$130M in their token generation event yesterday) will also be joining us to tell us all about how Polkadot bridges together different blockchains!</b>. (The original speaker was Marek Kotewicz, but availability didn't work out).

Space is limited to 70 attendees, so <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/matrix-and-friends-tickets-38729041606"><strong>please register on Eventbrite</strong></a> asap if you'd like to come!

As a taster: the official video of our massive talk from the ETHLDN meetup a few weeks ago was just released (see below).  The meetup in Berlin will have different content and be more free-form, letting folks ask their own questions and steer the conversation and discussion as you see fit: so please come hang out in person, grab pizza and beer courtesy of BlueYard, and find the answers to all the deepest Matrix questions you never knew you even had...!

See you next week! :D

Come hack something cool together using Matrix, either in Chicago or remotely! At <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/2015/04/13/tadhack-mini-london-completed/">past TADHacks</a> we've seen a robot controlled with Matrix, collaborative web page viewing with Matrix as the underlying protocol, and more.

The HR-OS1 is a hackable, modular, humanoid robot development platform designed from the ground up with customization and modification in mind. With a Raspberry Pi 2, webcam, wifi, bluetooth, and all of the limbs you expect for a human, there's a lot of scope for exciting projects to be had with it!

I for one would love to ask an open source robot to bring me snacks over chat. (Wow that's a sentence I never thought I would be able to say)
I'll be on site, (and also hanging out in on Matrix in <a href="https://matrix.org/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a>) to help out with whatever creative things y'all come up with - I hope to see you there!

Also in Chicago the following week I'll be giving a tutorial on <a href="http://www.rtc-conference.com/tutorials/">Federated Identity</a> as well as attending and speaking about the problem of fragmented communication at the <a href="http://www.rtc-conference.com/">IIT Real-Time Communications</a> Conference &amp; Expo.

If you're going to be around, please do say hi - I only recently joined the Matrix team, and there's a lot of people I've yet to meet - I look forward to seeing you at one (or all) of these events!

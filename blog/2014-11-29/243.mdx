title: Synapse 0.5.3a released!

Since we exited alpha and released Synapse 0.5.0 last week there's been a flurry of bug fix releases as we ran around firefighting some of the more exciting problems which popped up thanks to merging the federation-auth and event-signing branches.

We released 0.5.3a on Nov 27, which seems to now be pretty stable - if you were holding off on upgrading your homeserver and trying to federate with the new 0.5 release branch, now would be a great time to press the button!

Most excitingly, we believe we have <strong>finally fixed the PyNaCL dependency problems</strong> which have plagued pretty much anyone setting up a homeserver.  This was a problem in PyNaCL itself - huge thanks to Mark for hunting it down and sending the PyNaCL team <a href="http://git.io/1Rr5OA">pull</a> <a href="http://git.io/SUHmBA">requests</a> to get it fixed.  As a result, installing synapse as of 0.5.3a really should be a one-liner at last (please let us know if it isn't!):

<code>pip install --user --process-dependency-links https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tarball/master</code>

The full changelog of what's been going on since 0.5.0 is as follows:

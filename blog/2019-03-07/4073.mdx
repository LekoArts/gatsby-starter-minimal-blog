<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi all,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Heads up that<a href="https://modular.im"> Modular.im</a> (the paid hosting Matrix service provided by <a href="https://vector.im">New Vector</a>, the company who employs much of the Matrix core team) launched a pilot today for paid Matrix integrations in the form of paid sticker packs.  Yes kids, it's true - for only $0.50 you can slap Matrix and Riot hex stickers all over your chatrooms. It's a toy example to test the payments infrastructure and demonstrate the concept - the proceeds go towards funding development work on Matrix.org :)  </span>You can read more about over on <a href="https://www.modular.im/stickers">Modular's blog</a>.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to elaborate on this a bit from the Matrix.org perspective, specifically:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are categorically <strong>not</strong> baking payments or financial incentives as a first class citizen into Matrix, and we're not going to start moving stuff behind paywalls or similar.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This demo is a proof-of-concept to illustrate how folks could do this sort of thing in general in Matrix - it's not a serious product in and of itself.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What it shows is that an Integration Manager like Modular can be used as a way to charge for services in Matrix - whether that's digital content within an integration, or bots/bridges/etc. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Modular today gathers payments via credit-card (Stripe), it could certainly support other mechanisms (e.g. cryptocurrencies) in future.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea in future is for Modular to provide this as a mechanism that <em>anyone</em> can use to charge for content on Matrix - e.g. if you have your own sticker pack and want to sell it to people, you'll be able to upload it and charge people for it.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, there's a lot of interesting stuff on the horizon with integration managers in general - see </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1236"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSC1236</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and an upcoming MSC from TravisR (based around <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1286">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1286</a>) proposing new integration capabilities.  We're also hoping to implement inline widgets soon (e.g. chatbot buttons for voting and other semantic behaviour) which should make widgets even more interesting!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, feel free to go stick some hex stickers on your rooms if you like and help test this out.  In future there should be more useful things available :)</span>

Hi All,

We have patched two securities vulnerabilities (details follow), we do not believe either have been exploited in the wild, but recommend upgrading asap.

As always you can get the new update from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.1">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.1</a> or from any of the sources mentioned at <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/</a>

Thanks

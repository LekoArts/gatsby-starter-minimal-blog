Earlier this year we went to <a href="http://fosdem.org" title="FOSDEM">FOSDEM</a> - as reported in an <a href="http://matrix.org/blog/2015/02/04/back-from-fosdem/" title="earlier blog post">earlier blog post</a>. 

Both the recording equipment and the video team volunteers were new this year, so some problems were encountered, which means that our lightning talk video unfortunately was lost. However, our talk in the IoT-devroom is now available:

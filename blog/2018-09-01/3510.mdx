<h2 id="spec">The Spec</h2>
As many know, we've been aiming for the end of August to cut the first ever stable releases of the remaining APIs in the spec which have up to now been marked unstable - i.e. providing a snapshot of the spec which correctly matches the reference implementations (other than implementation bugs) and which can be used in isolation to develop production grade implementations of clients, servers, etc without need to reference any other implementations. There's been a massive sprint to pull this together, and as of the time of writing there are still <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr">PRs and commits</a> landing every few minutes.  We'll post a full update on our progress on Monday; meanwhile you can see a sneak peek over at the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/projects/1">August 2018 r0</a> project board.

Spec work has completely precluded any other backend dev this week.

This week we <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/08/31/so-long-half-shot-thanks-for-all-the-bridges/">say farewell</a> to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a>, who has been working fulltime on bridges over the summer. He has managed the matrix.org bridges largely single-handedly, with a big focus on the often-volatile IRC bridge(s).

<h3 id="whatsapp">WhatsApp</h3>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working on <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp">mautrix-whatsapp</a> bridge.
<blockquote>now bridges a lot more stuff, such as formatting, media and replies. I'm also almost done with desegregating users so that Matrix users join the same group chat portals rather than everyone having their own portal to the same chat</blockquote>
<h3 id="zulipchatbridgedbyzulip">Zulip chat, bridged by Zulip</h3>
Matthew discovered there is a Matrix-Zulip bridge on the Zulip side. So if you're running a Zulip server (for some reason), and want to bridge with Matrix <a href="https://zulipchat.com/integrations/doc/matrix">check out the integration docs here</a>.
<h3 id="ircconnectiontracker">IRC Connection Tracker</h3>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Half-Shot</a> created a new component to enhance the reliability of IRC-Matrix bridging:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/Half-Shot/irc-conntrack">IRC Connection Tracker</a> is a thing now. It's a project to separate out the IRC connections from the appservice so the two can be run independently, so that restarting the appservice doesn't affect the IRC connections. It's hopefully going to allow bridge stuff to run faster when it's done.</blockquote>
This project is still really early stage. You can take a look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NZRdUYHWltq9rh-nFZeSp3FYwtQQh5vBxa6Lw8YNtCo/">Proposal document here</a>.
<h2 id="clients">Clients</h2>
<h3 id="nheko054">Nheko 0.5.4</h3>
Not technically this week, but <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">Nheko</a> <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko/releases/tag/v0.5.4">0.5.4 was recently released</a>
<ul>
 	<li>The settings page now includes the device id &amp; device fingerprint (thanks <a href="https://github.com/valkum">@valkum</a> )</li>
 	<li>The Polish translation has been updated (thanks <a href="https://github.com/m4sk1n">@m4sk1n</a> )</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fractal">Fractal</h3>
<a href="@afranke:matrix.org">Alexandre Franke</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blizzard-Bay-Hanging-Gnomies-Sweater/dp/B0744PKXMK">GNOME crew</a> have been working on <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a>, gearing up for their upcoming 3.30 release.
<blockquote>Fractal 3.29.92 got released and we are freezing strings to give GNOME translators a bit of time to complete translations for 3.30 next week. Latest developments include tweaks for the title bar, misc bug fixes, a new presentation for uploaded files (that are not images, those are still displayed inline) with buttons to download or open them.
Development builds are now parallel installable for easier testing and CI has been improved.</blockquote>
<h3 id="seaglass">Seaglass</h3>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org">neilalexander</a>:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass">Seaglass</a> now has some early support for inline images and attachments, and supports Quick Look. Also handles emotes and notices better. It also has version numbers now, various other little fixes and Aaron Raimist has been working on auto-update support.</blockquote>
Version numbers! Now when you go to <a href="https://bintray.com/neilalexander/Seaglass/Seaglass/_latestVersion#files">download the tarball from bintray</a>, you can see what's going on!

There's also been some work on supporting dark mode on Mojave (which looks particularly sexy) and even Touch Bar support!

<blockquote>This is a tiny webextension to forward matrix.to links to an open Riot tab.</blockquote>
Really useful if you often click matrix.to links and find yourself needing to URL-hack to get to where you need to be.

We're going to shift this week's Matrix Live to Monday, alongside the upcoming blog post on the spec release progress. Have a good weekend!

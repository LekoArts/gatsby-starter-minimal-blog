<span style="font-weight: 400;">After releasing Synapse v0.34.1, we have become aware of a security vulnerability affecting all previous versions (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5885">CVE-2019-5885</a>). v0.34.1 closed the vulnerability but, in some cases, caused users to be logged out of their clients, so we do not recommend 0.34.1 for production use.</span>

<b>Today we release two mitigating versions v0.34.0.1 and v0.34.1.1</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Both versions close the vulnerability and will not cause users to be logged out. </span><b>All installations should be upgraded to one or other immediately.</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Admins who would otherwise upgrade to v0.34.1 (or those that have already done so) should upgrade to v0.34.1.1. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Admins on v0.34.0, who do not wish to bring in new non-security related behaviour, should upgrade to v0.34.0.1.</span></li>
</ul>

See also our <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/installing-synapse">Synapse installation guide page.</a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We will publish more details of the vulnerability once admins have had a chance to upgrade. To our knowledge the vulnerability has not been exploited in the wild.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many thanks for your patience, we are moving ever closer to Synapse reaching v1.0, and fixes like this one edge us ever closer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks also to the package maintainers who have coordinated with us to ensure distro packages are available for a speedy upgrade!</span>

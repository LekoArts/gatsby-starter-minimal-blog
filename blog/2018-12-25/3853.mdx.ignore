<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi all,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's that time again where we break out the mince pies and brandy butter (at least for those of us in the UK) and look back on the year to see how far Matrix has come, as well as anticipate what 2019 may bring!</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overview</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's fair to say that 2018 has been a pretty crazy year.  We have had one overriding goal: to take the </span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/01/29/status-partners-up-with-new-vector-fueling-decentralised-comms-and-the-matrix-ecosystem/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we received in January, stabilise and freeze the protocol and get it and the reference implementations out of beta and to a 1.0 - to provide a genuinely open and decentralised mainstream alternative to the likes of Slack, Discord, WhatsApp etc.  What's so crazy about that, you might ask?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, in parallel with this we've also seen adoption of Matrix accelerating ahead of our dev plan at an unprecedented speed: with France selecting Matrix to power the communication infrastructure of its whole public sector - first </span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/04/26/matrix-and-riot-confirmed-as-the-basis-for-frances-secure-instant-messenger-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trialling over the summer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and now </span><a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1070392608801910784"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed for full roll-out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as of a few weeks ago.  Meanwhile there are several other similar-sized projects on the horizon which we can't talk about yet.  We've had the growing pains of establishing </span><a href="https://vector.im"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Vector</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a startup in order to hire the core team and support these projects.  We've launched </span><a href="https://modular.im"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modular</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide professional-quality SaaS Matrix hosting for the wider community and help fund the team.  And most importantly, we've also been establishing the non-profit </span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matrix.org Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to formalise the open governance of the Matrix protocol and protect and isolate it from any of the for-profit work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However: things have just about come together.  Almost all the spec work for 1.0 is done and we are now aiming to get a 1.0 released in time by the end of January (in time for FOSDEM).  Meanwhile Synapse has improved massively in terms of performance and stability (not least having migrated over to </span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/12/21/porting-synapse-to-python-3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">); Riot's spectacular redesign is now </span><a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/redesign-experimenters-needed-afa7c2d4c858"><span style="font-weight: 400;">available for testing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> right now; E2E encryption is more stable than ever with the usability rework </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/compare/develop...uhoreg:e2e_cross-signing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">landing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as we speak.  And we've even got a full rewrite of Riot/Android in the wings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But it's certainly been an interesting ride.  Longer-term spec work has been delayed by needing to apply band-aids to mitigate abuse of the outstanding issues.  Riot redesign was pushed back considerably due to prioritising Riot performance over UX. The E2E UX work has forced us to consider E2E holistically… which does not always interact well with structuring the dev work into bite-sized chunks.  Dendrite has generally been idling whilst we instead pour most of our effort into getting to 1.0 on Synapse (rather than diluting 1.0 work across both projects). These tradeoffs have been hard to make, but hopefully we have chosen the correct path in the end.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, as we approach 1.0, the project is looking better than ever - hopefully everyone has seen both Riot and Synapse using less RAM and being more responsive and stable, E2E being more reliable, and anyone who has played with the </span><a href="https://riot.im/experimental"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riot redesign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> beta should agree that it is light-years ahead of yesterday's Riot and something which can genuinely surpass today's centralised proprietary incumbents. And that is unbelievably exciting :D</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We'd like to thank everyone for continuing to support Matrix - especially our </span><a href="http://patreon.com/matrixdotorg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patreon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; </span><a href="http://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberapay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supporters, whose donations continue to be critical for helping fund the core dev team, and also those who are supporting the project indirectly by hosting homeservers with </span><a href="https://modular.im"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modular</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  We are going to do everything humanly possible to ship 1.0 over the coming weeks, and then the sky will be the limit!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before going into what else 2019 will hold, however, let's take the opportunity to give a bit more detail on the various core team projects which landed in 2018…</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">France</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">DINSIC (France's Ministry of Digital, IT &amp; Comms) have been busy building out their massive cross-government Matrix deployment and custom Matrix client throughout most of the year.  After the </span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/04/26/matrix-and-riot-confirmed-as-the-basis-for-frances-secure-instant-messenger-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcement in April</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this started off with an initial deployment over the summer, and is now moving towards the full production rollout, as confirmed at the Paris Open Source Summit a few weeks ago by Mounir Mahjoubi, the Secretary of State of Digital.  All the press coverage about this ended up in French, with the biggest writeup being at </span><a href="https://www.cio-online.com/actualites/lire-mounir-mahjoubi%C2%A0-%C2%A0le-libre-n-est-pas-toujours-moins-cher-mais-c-est-toujours-plus-transparent%C2%A0-10842.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CIO Online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the main mention of Matrix (badly translated from French) is:</span>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denouncing the use of tools such as WhatsApp; a practice that has become commonplace within ministerial offices, Mounir Mahjoubi announced the launch in production of Tchap, based on Matrix and Riot: an instant messaging tool that will be provided throughout the administrations. So, certainly, developing a product can have a certain cost. Integrating it too. "Free is not always cheaper but it's always more transparent," admitted the Secretary of State.</span></i></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The project really shows off Matrix at its best, with up to 60 different deployments spread over different ministries and departments; multiple clusters per Ministry; end-to-end encryption enabled by default (complete with e2e-aware antivirus scanning); multiple networks for different classes of traffic; and the hope of federating with the public Matrix network once the S2S API is finalised and suitable border gateways are available.  It's not really our project to talk about, but we'll try to share as much info as we can as roll-out continues.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Matrix Specification</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A major theme throughout the year has been polishing the </span><a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matrix Spec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> itself for its first full stable release, having had more than enough time to see which bits work in practice now and which bits need rethinking.  This all kicked off with the </span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/05/17/introducing-matrix-specification-changes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creation of the Matrix Spec Change process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back in May, which provides a formal process for reviewing and accepting contributions from anyone into the spec.  Getting the balance right between agility and robustness has been quite tough here, especially pre-1.0 where we've needed to move rapidly to resolve the remaining long-lived sticking points.  However, a process like this risks encouraging the classic “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect is the Enemy of Good</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” problem, as all and sundry jump in to apply their particular brand of perfectionism to the spec (and/or the process around it) and risk smothering it to death with enthusiasm.  So we've ended up iterating a few times on the process and hopefully now converged on an approach which will work for 1.0 and beyond. If you haven't checked out the current </span><a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> please give it a look, and feel free to marvel at all the MSCs in flight.  You can also see a </span><a href="https://matrix.org/~richardv/proposal_news.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quick and dirty timeline of all the MSC status changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since we introduced the process, to get an idea of how it's all been progressing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In August we had a big sprint to cut </span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/09/03/matrix-spec-update-august-2018/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stable “r0” releases of all the APIs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the spec which had not yet reached a stable release (i.e. all apart from the Client-Server API, which has been stable since Dec 2015 - hence in part the large number of usable independent Matrix clients relative to the other bits of the ecosystem).  In practice, we managed to release 3 out of the 4 remaining APIs - but needed more time to solve the remaining blocking issues with the Server-Server API. So since August (modulo operational and project distractions) we've been plugging away on the S2S API.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main blocking issue for a stable S2S API has been State Resolution. This is the fundamental algorithm used to determine the state of a given room whenever a race or partition happens between the servers participating in it.  For instance: if Alice kicks Bob on her server at the same time as Charlie ops Bob on his server, who should win? It's vital that all servers reach the same conclusion as to the state of the room, and we don't want servers to have to replicate a full copy of the room's history (which could be massive) to reach a consistent conclusion.  Matrix's original state resolution algorithm dates back to the initial usable S2S implementation at the beginning of 2015 - but over time deficiencies in the algorithm became increasingly apparent. The most obvious issue is the “</span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/2432"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hotel California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” bug, where users can be spontaneously re-joined to a room they've previously left if the room's current state is merged with an older copy of the room on another server and the ‘wrong' version wins the conflict - a so-called state-reset.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After a lot of thought we ended up proposing an </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/state_res_rejections/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all new State Resolution algorithm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July 2018, nicknamed State Resolution Reloaded.  This extends the original algorithm to consider the ‘auth chain' of state events when performing state resolution (i.e. the sequence of events that a given state event cites as evidence of its validity) - as well as addressing a bunch of other issues.  For those wishing to understand in more detail, there's </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/state_res_rejections/proposals/1442-state-resolution.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the MSC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> itself, the formal terse description of the algorithm now merged into the </span><a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/server_server/unstable.html#state-resolution-algorithm-for-version-2-rooms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unstable S2S spec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - or alternatively there's an excellent </span><a href="https://matrix.uhoreg.ca/stateres/reloaded.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">step-by-step explanation and guided example</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from uhoreg (warning: contains Haskell :)  Or you can watch Erik and Matthew try to explain it all on </span><a href="https://youtu.be/f6ZdmPSUUBA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matrix Live</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back in July.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the initial proposal in July, the algorithm has been proofed out in a </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-test-state-resolution-ideas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">test jig</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, iterated on some more to better specify </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1693"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to handle rejected events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4040"><span style="font-weight: 400;">implemented in Synapse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and is now ready to roll.  The only catch is that to upgrade to it we've had to introduce the concept of </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1516/files"><span style="font-weight: 400;">room versioning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and to flush out historical issues we require you to </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/room_upgrades/proposals/1501-room-version-upgrades.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">re-create rooms to upgrade them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the new resolution algorithm. Getting the logistics in place for this is a massive pain, but we've got an approach now which should be sufficient. Clients will be free to smooth over the transition in the UI as gracefully as possible (and in fact Riot has this already hooked up).  So: watch this space as v2 rooms with all-new state resolution in the coming weeks!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, there are a bunch of other issues in the S2S API which we are still working through (e.g. </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/event_id_hashes/proposals/1640-event-id-as-hashes.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changing event IDs to be hashes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of event contents to avoid lying about IDs, </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1711"><span style="font-weight: 400;">switching to use normal X.509 certificates for federation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and so resolve problems with Perspectives, etc).  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once these land and are implemented in Synapse over the coming weeks, we will be able to finally declare a 1.0!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also on the spec side of things, it's worth noting that a lot of effort went into improving performance for clients in the form of the </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1227"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lazy Loading Members MSC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  This ended up consuming a lot of time over the summer as we updated Synapse and the various matrix-*-sdks (and thus Riot) to only calculate and send details to the clients about members who are currently talking in a room, whereas previously we sent the entire state of the room to the client (even including users who had left). The end result however is a 3-5x reduction in RAM on Riot, and a 3-5x speedup on initial sync.  The current MSC is currently being </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1758"><span style="font-weight: 400;">merged as we speak</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the main spec (thanks Kitsune!) for inclusion in upcoming CS API 0.5.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Matrix.org Foundation (CIC!)</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside getting the open spec process up and running, we've been establishing The Matrix.org Foundation as an independent non-profit legal entity responsible for neutrally safeguarding the Matrix spec and evolution of the protocol.  This kicked off in June with the “</span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/06/20/towards-open-governance-for-matrix-org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Towards Open Governance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” blog post, and continued with the </span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">formal incorporation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of The Matrix.org Foundation in October.  Since then, we've spent a lot of time with the non-profit lawyers evolving </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1318"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSC1318</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the final Articles of Association (and other guidelines) for the Foundation.  This work is basically solved now; it just needs MSC1318 to be updated with the conclusions (which we're running late on, but is top of Matthew's MSC todo list).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other news, we have confirmation that the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_interest_company"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Interest Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (CIC) status for The Matrix.org Foundation has been approved - this means that the CIC Regulator has independently reviewed the initial Articles of Association and approved that they indeed lock the mission of the Foundation to be non-profit and to act solely for the good of the wider online community.  In practice, this means that the Foundation will be formally renamed The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C, and provides a useful independent safeguard to ensure the Foundation remains on track.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining work on the Foundation is:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update and land MSC1318, particularly on clarifying the relationship between the legal Guardians (Directors) of the Foundation and the technical members of the core spec team, and how funds of the Foundation will be handled.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Update the Articles of Association of the Foundation based on the end result of MSC1318</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transfer any Matrix.org assets over from New Vector to the Foundation.  Given Matrix's code is all open source, there isn't much in the way of assets - we're basically talking about the matrix.org domain and website itself.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduce the final Guardians for the Foundation.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We'll keep you posted with progress as this lands over the coming months.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riot</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 has been a bit of a chrysalis year for Riot: the vast majority of work has been going into the </span><a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/a-sneak-peek-at-a-whole-new-riot-im-1114df653782"><span style="font-weight: 400;">massive redesign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we started in May to improve usability &amp; cosmetics, performance, stability, and E2E encryption usability improvements.  We've consciously spent most of the year feature frozen in order to polish what we already have, as we've certainly been guilty in the past of landing way too many features without necessarily applying the needed amount of UX polish.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as of today, we're super-excited to announce that Riot's redesign is at the point where the intrepid can start experimenting with it - in fact, internally most of the team has switched over to dogfooding (testing) the redesign as of a week or so ago.  Just shut down your current copy of Riot/Web or Desktop and go to </span><a href="https://riot.im/experimental"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://riot.im/experimental</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead if you want to experiment (we don't recommend running both at the same time).  Please note that it is still work-in-progress and there's a lot of polish still to land and some cosmetic bugs still hanging around, but it's definitely at the point of feeling better than the old app.  Most importantly, please provide feedback (by hitting the lifesaver-ring button at the bottom left) to let us know how you get on. See the </span><a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/redesign-experimenters-needed-afa7c2d4c858"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riot blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for more details!</span>

<a href="https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-25-at-04.00.44.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3854" src="https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-2018-12-25-at-04.00.44-1024x578.png" alt="" width="1024" height="578" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, on the performance and stability side of things - Lazy Loading (see above) made a </span><a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/riot-im-web-0-17-and-ios-0-7-6-smaller-footprint-faster-launch-5ddd18a65abb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">massive difference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to performance on all platforms; shrinking RAM usage by 3-5x and similarly speeding up launch and initial sync times.  Ironically, this ended up pushing back the redesign work, but hopefully the performance improvements will have been noticeable in the interim.  We also </span><a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/6477"><span style="font-weight: 400;">switched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the entire rich text composer from using Facebook's </span><a href="https://draftjs.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draft.js</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> library to instead use </span><a href="https://www.slatejs.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slate.js</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which has generally been a massive improvement for stability and maintainability, although took *</span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/1890"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">* to land - huge thanks to t3chguy for getting it over the line). Meanwhile Travis has been blitzing through a massive list of key “</span><a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/projects/12"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Impression</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” bugs to ensure that as many of Riot's most glaring usability gotchas are solved.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also welcomed ever-popular </span><a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/stickers-are-here-introducing-riot-im-0-15-for-web-desktop-284c32b93acc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stickers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the fold - the first instance of per-account rather than per-room widgets, which ended up requiring a lot of new infrastructure in both Riot and the underlying integration manager responsible for hosting the widgets.  But judging by how popular they are, the effort seems to be worth it - and paves the way for much more exciting interactive widgets and integrations in future!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An unexpectedly large detour/distraction came in the form of GDPR back in May - we spent a month or so running around ensuring that both Riot and Matrix are GDPR compliant (including the necessary legal legwork to establish how GDPR even applies to a decentralised technology like Matrix).  If you missed all that fun, you can </span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/05/08/gdpr-compliance-in-matrix/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read about it here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Hopefully we won't have to do anything like that again any time soon...</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally: on the mobile side, much of the team has been distracted helping out France with their Matrix deployment.  However, we've been plugging away on Riot/Mobile, keeping pace with the development on Riot/Web - but most excitingly, we've also found time to experiment with a </span><a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-android-redesign-PoC/tree/develop"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complete rewrite of Riot/Android</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Kotlin, using Realm and Rx (currently nicknamed Riot X).  The rewrite was originally intended as a test-jig for experimenting with the redesign on mobile, but it's increasingly becoming a fully fledged Matrix client… which launches and syncs over 5x faster than today's Riot/Android.  If you're particularly intrepid you should be able to run the app by checking out the project in Android Studio and hitting ‘run'. We expect the rewrite to land properly in the coming months - watch this space for progress!</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">E2E Encryption</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest projects this year has been to get E2E encryption out of beta and </span><a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/issues/6779"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turned on by default</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Now, whilst the encryption itself in Matrix has been </span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cryptographically robust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since 2016 - its usability has been minimal at best, and we'd been running around polishing the underlying implementation rather than addressing the UX.  However, this year that changed, as we opened a war on about 6 concurrent battlefronts to address the remaining issues. These are:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holistic UX.  Designing a coherent, design-led UX across all of the encryption and key-management functionality.  Nad (who joined Matrix as a fulltime Lead UI/UX designer in August) has been leading the charge on this - you can see a </span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/11/02/user-experience-preview-end-to-end-encryption-by-default/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preview of the end result</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here.  Meanwhile, Dave and Ryan are working through implementing it as we speak.
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decryption failures (UISIs).  Whenever something goes wrong with E2E encryption, the symptoms are generally the same: you find yourself unable to decrypt other people's messages.  We've been plugging away chasing these down - for instance, </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/597"><span style="font-weight: 400;">switching from localStorage to IndexedDB</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Riot/Web for storing encryption state (to make it harder for multiple tabs to collide and corrupt your encryption state); providing mechanisms to </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/780"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unwedge Olm sessions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which have got corrupted (e.g. by restoring from backup); and many others.  We also added full telemetry to track the number of UISIs people are seeing in practice - and the good news is that over the course of the year their occurrence has been steadily reducing.  The bad news is that there are still some edge cases left: so please, whenever you fail to decrypt a message, please make sure you submit a bug report and debug logs from *both* the sender and receiving device.  The end is definitely in sight on these, however, and good news is other battlefronts will also help mitigate UISIs.
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incremental Key Backup.  Previously, if you only used one device (e.g. your phone) and you lost that phone, you would lose all your E2E history unless you were in the habit of explicitly manually backing up your keys.  Nowadays, we have the ability to optionally let users encrypt their keys with a passphrase (or recovery key) and </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1703"><span style="font-weight: 400;">constantly upload them to the server</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for safe keeping.  This was a significant chunk of work, but has actually </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/2169"><span style="font-weight: 400;">landed already</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Riot/Web and Riot/iOS, but is hidden behind a “Labs” feature flag in Settings whilst we test it and sort out the final UX.
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-signing Keys. Previously, the only way to check whether you were talking to a legitimate user or an imposter was to independently compare the fingerprints of the keys of the device they claim to be using.  In the near future, we will let users prove that they own their devices by </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1756"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signing them with a per-user identity key</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so you only have to do this check once. We've actually </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/795"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already implemented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one iteration of cross-signing, but this </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1680"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed arbitrary devices for a given user to attest each other</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which creates a directed graph of attestations, and associated problems with revocations), hence switching to a simpler approach.
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved Verification. Verifying keys by manually comparing elliptic key fingerprints is incredibly cumbersome and tedious.  Instead, we have proposals for using </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1267"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short Authentication String</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comparisons and </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1543"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QR-code scanning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to simplify the process.  uhoreg is currently implementing these as we speak :)
</span></span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Search.  Solving encrypted search is Hard, but t3chguy did a lot of work earlier in the year to build out </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-search"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matrix-search</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: essentially a js-sdk bot which you can host, hand your keys to, and will archive your history using a golang full-text search engine (bleve) and expose a search interface that replaces Synapse's default one.  Of all the battlefronts this one is progressing the least right now, but the hope is to integrate it into Riot/Desktop or other clients so that folks who want to index all their conversations have the means to do so.  On the plus side, all the necessary building blocks are available thanks to t3chguy's hacking.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, TL;DR: E2E is hard, but the end is in sight thanks to a lot of blood, sweat and tears.  It's possible that we may have opened up too many battlefronts in finishing it off rather than landing stuff gradually.  But it should be transformative when it all lands - and we'll finally be able to turn it on by default for private conversations.  Again, we're aiming to pull this together by the end of January.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Separately, we've been keeping a close eye on </span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/about/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MLS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - the IETF's activity around standardising scalable group E2E encryption.  MLS has a lot of potential and could provide algorithmic improvements over Olm &amp; Megolm (whist paving the way for interop with other MLS-encrypted comms systems).  But it's also quite complicated, and is at risk of designing out support of decentralised environments. For now, we're obviously focusing on ensuring that Matrix is rock solid with Olm &amp; Megolm, but once we hit that 1.0 we'll certainly be experimenting a bit with MLS too.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeservers</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of the Synapse team in 2018 has been one of alternating between solving scaling and performance issues to support the ever-growing network (especially the massive matrix.org server)... and dealing with S2S API issues; both in terms of fixing the design of State Resolution, Room Versioning etc (see the Spec section above) and doing stop-gap fixes to the current implementation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Focusing on the performance side of things, the main wins have been:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Splitting yet more functionality out into worker processes which can scale independently of the master Synapse process.
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet more profiling and optimisation (particularly caching).  Between this and the worker split-out we were able to resolve the performance ceiling that we hit over the summer, and as of right now matrix.org feels relatively snappy.
</span></span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lazy Loading Members.
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/12/21/porting-synapse-to-python-3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Python 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  As everyone should have seen by now, Synapse is now Python 3 by default as of 0.34, which provides significant RAM and CPU improvements across the board as well as a path forwards given Python 2's planned demise at the end of 2019.  If you're not running your Synapse on Python 3 today, you are officially doing it wrong.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also some major improvements which haven't fully landed yet:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State compression.  We have a new algorithm for storing room state which is ~10x more efficient than the current one.  We'll be migrating to it in by default in future. If you're feeling particularly intrepid you can actually </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/rust-synapse-compress-state"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manually use it today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (but we don't recommend it yet).
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incremental state resolution.  Before we got sucked into redesigning state resolution in general, Erik came up with a </span><a href="https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/jki.re/ubNfLtrmXZMmlGjJZYPnlHHy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proof that it's possible to memoize state resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and incrementally calculate it whenever state is resolved in a room rather than recalculate it from scratch each time (as is the current implementation).  This would be a significant performance improvement, given non-incremental state res can consume a lot of CPU (making everything slow down when there are lots of room extremities to resolve), and can consume a lot of RAM and has been one of the reasons that synapse's RAM usage can sometimes spike badly. The good news is that the new state res algorithm was designed to also work in this manner.  The bad news is that we haven't yet got back to implementing it yet, given the new algorithm is only just being rolled out now.
</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1229"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chunks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Currently, Synapse models all events in a room as being part of a single DAG, which can be problematic if you can see lots of disconnected sections of the DAG (e.g. due to intermittent connectivity somewhere in the network), as Synapse will frantically try to resolve all these disconnected sections of DAG together.  Instead, a better solution is to explicitly model these sections of DAG as separate entities called Chunks, and not try to resolve state between disconnected Chunks but instead consider them independent fragments of the room - and thus simplify state resolution calculations significantly. It also fixes an S2S API design flaw where previously we trusted the server to state the ordering (depth) of events they provided; with chunks, the receiving server can keep track of that itself by tracking a DAG of chunks (as well as the normal event DAG within the chunks).  Now, most of the work for this happened already, but is </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/3785"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently parked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until new state res has landed.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, over on Dendrite, we made the conscious decision to get 1.0 out the door on Synapse first rather than trying to implement and iterate on the stuff needed for 1.0 on both Synapse &amp; Dendrite simultaneously.  However, Dendrite has been ticking along thanks to work from Brendan, Anoa and APWhitehat - and the plan is to use it for more niche homeserver work at first; e.g. constrained resource devices (Dendrite uses 5-10x less RAM than Synapse on Py3), clientside homeservers, experimental routing deployments, etc.  In the longer term we expect it to grow into a fully fledged HS though!</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridging</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 was a bit of a renaissance for Bridging, largely thanks to Half-Shot coming on board in the Summer to work on IRC bridging and finally get to the bottom of the stability issues which plagued Freenode for the previous, uh, few years.  Meanwhile the Slack bridge got its first ever release - and more recently there's some Really Exciting Stuff happening with <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-purple">matrix-appservice-purple</a>; a properly usable bridge through to any protocol that libpurple can speak… and as of a few days ago also supports *native* XMPP bridging via XMPP.js.  There'll probably be a dedicated blogpost about all of this in the new year, especially when we deploy it all on Matrix.org. Until then, the best bet is to learn more is to watch </span><a href="https://youtu.be/B0faoVdw0ak"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last week's Matrix Live</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and hear it all first hand.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modular</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest newcomers of 2018 was the launch of </span><a href="https://modular.im"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modular.im</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in October - the world's first commercial Matrix hosting service.  Whilst (like Riot), Modular isn't strictly-speaking a Matrix.org project - it feels appropriate to mention it here, not least because it's helping directly fund the core Matrix dev team.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So far Modular has seen a lot of interest from folks who want to spin up a super-speedy dedicated homeserver run by us rather than having to spend the time to build one themselves - or folks who have yet to migrate from IRC and want a better-than-IRC experience which still bridges well.  One of the nice bits is that the servers are still decentralised and completely operationally independent of one another, and there have been a bunch of really nice refinements since launch, including the ability to point your own DNS at the server; matrix-&gt;matrix migration tools; with custom branding and other goodness coming soon.  If you want one-click Matrix hosting, please give Modular a go :) </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now we're promoting Modular mainly to existing Matrix users, but once the Riot redesign is finished you should expect to see some very familiar names popping up on the platform :D</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">TWIM</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you were living under a rock, you'll hopefully have also realised that 2018 was the year that brought us </span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/general/this-week-in-matrix/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Week In Matrix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (TWIM) - our very own blog tracking all the action across the whole Matrix community on a weekly basis.  Thank you to everyone who contributes updates, and to Ben for editing it each week. Go flip through the archives to find out what's been going on in the wider community over the course of the year!  (This blog post is already way too long without trying to cover the rest of the ecosystem too :)</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shapes of Things to Come</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, a little Easter egg (it is Christmas, after all) for anyone crazy enough to have read this far: The eagle-eyed amongst you might have noticed that one of our accepted talks for FOSDEM 2019 is “</span><a href="https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/matrix/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breaking the 100bps barrier with Matrix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” in the Real Time Communications devroom.  We don't want to spoil the full surprise, but here's a quick preview of some of the more exotic </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project"><span style="font-weight: 400;">skunkworks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we've been doing on low-bandwidth routing and transports recently.  Right now it shamelessly assumes that you're running within a trusted network, but once we solve that it will of course be be proposed as an MSC for Matrix proper.  A full write-up and code will follow, but for now, here's a mysterious video…</span>

<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vimXuCTxV6k" width="128" height="800" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">(If you're interested in running Matrix over low-bandwidth networks, please </span><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get in touch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - we'd love to hear from you...)</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what will 2019 bring?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the short term, as should be obvious from the above, our focus is on:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">r0 spec releases across the board (aka Matrix 1.0)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing them in Synapse</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landing the Riot redesign</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landing all the new E2E encryption UX and features</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finalising the Matrix.org Foundation</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, beyond that, there's a lot of possible options on the table in the medium term:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reworking and improving Communities/Groups.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reactions.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E2E-encrypted Search</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filtering. (empowering users to filter out rooms &amp; content they're not interested in).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensible events.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editable messages.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensible Profiles (we've actually been experimenting with this already).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threading.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landing the Riot/Android rewrite</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scaling synapse via sharding the master process</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridge UI for discovery of users/rooms and bridge status</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering whether to do a similar overhaul of Riot/iOS</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bandwidth-efficient transports</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bandwidth-efficient routing</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting Dendrite to production.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inline widgets (polls etc)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving VoIP over Matrix.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding more bridges, and improving the current ones..</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account portability</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing MXIDs with public keys</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the longer term, options include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shared-code cross-platform client SDKs (e.g. sharing a native core library between matrix-{js,ios,android}-sdk)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matrix daemons (e.g. running an always-on client as a background process in your OS which apps can connect to via a lightweight CS API)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push notifications via Matrix (using a daemon-style architecture)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clientside homeservers (i.e. p2p matrix) - e.g. compiling Dendrite to WASM and running it in a service worker.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experimenting with MLS for E2E Encryption</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storing and querying more generic data structures in Matrix (e.g. object trees; scene graphs)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternate use cases for VR, IoT, etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously we're not remotely going to do all of that in 2019, but this serves to give a taste of the possibilities on the menu post-1.0; we'll endeavour to publish a more solid roadmap when we get to that point.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And on that note, it's time to call this blogpost to a close. Thanks to anyone who read this far, and thank you, as always, for flying Matrix and continuing to support the project.  The next few months should be particularly fun; all the preparation of 2018 will finally pay off :)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Happy holidays,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew, Amandine &amp; the whole Matrix.org team.</span>

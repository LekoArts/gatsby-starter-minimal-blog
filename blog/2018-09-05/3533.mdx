<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi all,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the ongoing work to finalise a stable release of Matrix's Server-Server federation API, we've been doing a full audit of Synapse's implementation and have identified a serious vulnerability which we are going to release a security update to address (Synapse 0.33.3.1) on </span><b>Thursday Sept 6th 2018 at 12:00 UTC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are coordinating with package maintainers to ensure that patched versions of packages will be available at that time - meanwhile, if you run your own Synapse, <strong>please be prepared to upgrade as soon as the patched versions are released</strong>.  All previous versions of Synapse are affected, so everyone will want to upgrade.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your time, patience and understanding while we resolve the issue,</span>

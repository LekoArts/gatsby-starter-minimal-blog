Hi folks,

We're a little late with this, but Synapse 0.19.1 was released last week. The only change is a bugfix to a regression in room state replication that snuck in during the performance improvements that landed in 0.19.0. Please upgrade if you haven't already. We've also fixed the Debian repository to make installing Synapse easier on Jessie by including backported packages for stuff like Twisted where we're forced to use the latest releases.

You can grab it from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/</a> as always.

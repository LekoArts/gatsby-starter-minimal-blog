<h2 id="matrixlivesynapseroadmapandsynapse09911">Matrix Live, Synapse roadmap and Synapse 0.99.1.1</h2>
As you may have seen, Matrix Live this week features Neil and Matthew <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/15/publishing-the-backend-roadmap/">discussing the newly announced backend roadmap</a>.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LfyQ6cNGbLk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

We also have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.1.1">Synapse v0.99.1.1</a> available, as the race to Synapse v1.0 gets closer and closer and closer!

Brendan also said, regarding low-bandwidth:
<blockquote>Some of the week has been spent finalising the components used in <a href="https://video.fosdem.org/2019/H.1309/matrix.webm">the low-bandwidth demo we did at FOSDEM</a>. This required polishing some internal developments, which are now almost ready to be published to the wide world! This should happen in the next few days so stay tuned :)</blockquote>
<h2 id="riot100andhotfix101">Riot 1.0.0, and hotfix 1.0.1</h2>
If you're following Matrix much at all, you will surely have seen it by now: Riot, the most popular client, has <a href="https://medium.com/@RiotChat/the-big-1-0-68fa7c6050be">announced the v1.0 milestone</a>. I won't reiterate the features and improvements here, but do check out the blog post, or just head over to <a href="https://riot.im/app">https://riot.im/app</a> and see for yourself!

Particularly exciting is the new encryption verification process, involving sharing a list of emojis out-of-band:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@matrixdotorg</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RiotChat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RiotChat</a> - with the new update the office is full of people yelling names of emoji at each other</p>

<h2 id="newishpythonsdkmatrixnio">New(ish!) Python SDK: matrix-nio</h2>
Since we haven't featured their work here at all I wanted to give some space to <a href="https://github.com/poljar">poljar</a>. They've been working on a <a href="https://github.com/poljar/weechat-matrix">Weechat-Matrix protocol script</a>, but as part of this project they created a new Matrix client library, <a href="https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio">matrix-nio</a>, "designed according to <a href="http://sans-io.readthedocs.io/">sans I/O</a> principles".

As if this wasn't enough! <a href="https://github.com/poljar/python-olm">python-olm</a> is a library providing Python bindings for Olm (enabling E2E encryption for Matrix.)
<h2 id="fluffychatv11preview">FluffyChat v11 preview</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat">FluffyChat</a> is a pure QML Matrix client, designed to be used on smartphones running Ubuntu Touch. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@krille:chat.regionetz.net">Krille</a>, the author is working on:
<blockquote>boring refactoring stuff :-( at the moment to prepare everything for e2e encryption work</blockquote>
. . .which seems to me not boring at all - we can expect, in the next few months, another Matrix Client with E2EE support, and on mobile!

In my role as editor of this particular blog post, I enjoy certain luxuries that others might envy. For example, today, I tried a new preview build of FluffyChat. This I installed on my barely-repaired OnePlus One running Ubuntu Touch 16.04.

<h2 id="matrixarchivekeyring">matrix-archive-keyring</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been working on new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>:
<blockquote>I've paused porting Synapse to OpenBSD this week, while I attempt to both fix and <em>revert</em> some security issues caused by <code>sudo apt-key add</code> for Matrix.org and Riot.im packages for Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution users.

<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/4609">matrix-org/synapse PR #4609</a> was my first attempt to fix the problem, however I fell short this time in ease-of-use and my implementation had other issues. (Read: The <code>repo-key.asc</code> downloaded from Matrix.org Debian repository should go to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>, and must not be added by <code>apt-key add</code> or added to <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d</code> directly. I attempted the latter with my first PR; but that would've allowed the Matrix.org signing key to also be used to verify packages from Debian's main repositories. Yikes!)

As my second attempt, I'm now creating a new Debian package called <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code>. There's multiple things this package intends to do:
<ul>
 	<li>A post-install script to remove any previously added Matrix.org package signing keys from <code>/etc/apt/trusted.gpg</code>. (This is the file <code>apt-key add</code> most commonly uses, and the most commonly found bad advice on the Internet.)</li>
 	<li>Convert <code>repo-key.asc</code> to a de-armorized <code>.gpg</code> format, understood better by apt(8). (Essentially, <code>gpg --dearmor</code>.)</li>
 	<li>Install the converted <code>.gpg</code> key to <code>/usr/share/keyrings</code>.</li>
 	<li>Make sure <code>apt(8)</code> uses the newly added key for Matrix.org repository only?</li>
 	<li>Deliver any updates to <code>repo-key.asc</code> directly to you via <code>apt upgrade</code>. Your operating system might then also do it automatically for you if <code>unattended-upgrades(8)</code> is installed on your system. ?</li>
 	<li>Make sure everything goes away when this keyring package is uninstalled. No more <code>sudo sh -c 'apt-key del C35EB17E1EAE708E6603A9B3AD0592FE47F0DF61; rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> to get rid of the repository.</li>
</ul>
I have one more interesting enhancement to disclose.

We can ask you with <code>debconf</code> if you want to install <code>deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian $(lsb_release -cs) main</code> to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list</code> while you're installing the new keyring with <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code>.

You'll most likely notice the difference in install instructions, as a result of this package. Before and after:
<pre><code># Before
sudo apt install -y lsb-release curl apt-transport-https
echo "deb https://matrix.org/packages/debian `lsb_release -cs` main" |
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/matrix-org.list
curl "https://matrix.org/packages/debian/repo-key.asc" |
    sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt update
sudo apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
<pre><code># After
sudo apt install matrix-archive-keyring
sudo sh -c 'apt update &amp;&amp; apt install matrix-synapse-py3
</code></pre>
If you are a Debian or Ubuntu user and Synapse homeserver operator using Matrix.org repositories, I'll be towncrying when this package becomes available as much as I can. All you should need to do then is <code>apt install matrix-archive-keyring</code> and it should patch the security holes in your operating system if you've formerly installed packages from Matrix.org or Riot.im! (The command may change a bit, because next Debian operating system release "Buster" has entered soft-freeze just today (2019-02-12) and not accepting new packages into that release.)

PS: I'm at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#debian-matrix:matrix.org">#debian-matrix:matrix.org</a>, please come talk to us if Debian packaging interests you!</blockquote>
&nbsp;
<blockquote>For the eager early testers not afraid of building from source, <code>matrix-archive-keyring</code> version <code>2015.12.09+debian0.10</code> is available for early testing (attached).
<pre><code># Something like this!
sudo apt install devscripts
tar -xfvJ matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10.tar.xz
cd matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10
debuild -us -uc
sudo dpkg -i dpkg -i ../matrix-archive-keyring_2015.12.09+debian0.10_all
</code></pre>
Please follow <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=922155">Debian Bug#922155</a> for updates. Debian binary packages will be available later sometime this/next week from Debian's <code>unstable</code> distribution (<code>contrib</code>), if all goes well and there are no remaining Debian policy violations or serious bugs.

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> again:
<blockquote><a href="https://gitlab.com/kamax-io/grid/gridepo">Gridepo</a>, as a Matrix Homeserver, is gaining basic support for Matrix Client API. We have basic login, room creationg, message sending and sync working! A little screen recording of the progress can be viewed <a href="https://kamax.io/_matrix/media/v1/download/kamax.io/EOMDDlNERTqalHvADhokyItG">here</a> for live action with Riot. As a reminder, Gridepo is a clean rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxhsd</a>.<br /><br />This is not usable yet outside of a dev environment but we should have a first usable version with federation in a couple of weeks!</blockquote>

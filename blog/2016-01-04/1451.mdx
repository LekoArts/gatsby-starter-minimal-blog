Happy 2016 everyone!

To greet the new year, we bring you all new Synapse 0.12. The focus here has been a wide range of polishing, bugfixes, performance improvements and feature tweaks. The biggest news are that the 'v2' sync APIs are now production ready; the search APIs now work much better; 3rd party ID invites now work; and we now mount the whole client-server API under the <code>/_matrix/client/r0</code> URI prefix, as per the <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/spec/r0.0.0/client_server.html">r0.0.0 release of the Client Server API</a> from a few weeks ago. The <code>r0</code> release unifies what were previously the somewhat confusing mix of 'v1' and 'v2' APIs as a single set of endpoints which play nice together.

We highly recommend all homeservers upgrading to v0.12.0 as soon as possible. Get it now from <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/</a> or via our shiny new Debian packages at <a href="https://matrix.org/packages/debian/">https://matrix.org/packages/debian/</a>.

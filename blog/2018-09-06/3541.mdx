<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi All,</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As referenced in yesterday's </span><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2018/09/05/pre-disclosure-upcoming-critical-security-fix-for-synapse/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pre-disclosure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, today we are releasing Synapse 0.33.3.1 as a critical security update.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have patched two security vulnerabilities we identified whilst working on the upcoming r0 spec release for the Server-Server API (see details below). We do not believe either have been exploited in the wild, but strongly recommend everybody running a federated Synapse upgrades immediately. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As always you can get the new update <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.33.3.1">here</a> or from any of the sources mentioned at </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many thanks for your patience and understanding; with fixes like this we are moving ever closer to Synapse reaching a 1.0 Thanks also to the package maintainers who have coordinated with us to ensure distro packages are available for a speedy upgrade!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Note, for anyone running Debian Jessie, we have prepared a 0.33.2.1 deb (as 0.33.3 dropped support for Jessie).</span>

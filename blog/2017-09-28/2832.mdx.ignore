<strong><em>TL;DR: If you love FOSS-friendly hardware and if you love Matrix, please <a href="https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/">preorder a Purism Librem5 Matrix-native smartphone</a>, so we can fully bring native Matrix communication to both phones and desktop!</em></strong>

It's been just over a month since Purism announced the campaign to fund the <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2017/08/24/the-librem-5-from-purism-a-matrix-native-smartphone/">Matrix-native Librem5 FOSS smartphone</a> - and the campaign is doing pretty well, with 54% of its target reached as of the time of writing!  So in a shameless attempt to whet everyone's appetite and <a href="https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/">encourage everyone to fund the remaining 50%</a>, we thought we'd share some of the experiments we've been doing with running native Matrix clients on a pure Linux phone.

Unfortunately the Librem5 doesn't exist yet, but we do happen to have an <a href="https://store.bq.com/en/ubuntu-edition-e5/">BQ Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Phone</a> hanging around - so we wondered: Is it possible to run a native desktop Matrix client like mujx's <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">Nheko</a> on a Linux phone, given all the latest Qt voodoo? And just how hard is it anyway to update the Qt platform abstractions (or GTK for that matter) for a given platform?  In retrospect, we probably should have just run <a href="https://github.com/LarreaMikel/uMatriks">uMatriks</a> on it - a proper dedicated Ubuntu Touch Matrix Client, but then we wouldn't have had a useful tour of maintaining the guts of a Qt distribution on mobile :)

So the core problem of running a client like Nheko on Ubuntu Touch is that it uses lots of fun glossy stuff from Qt 5.9, whereas Ubuntu Touch is still on Qt 5.4, which is over 2 years old now.  Also, it's been written as a desktop client so needs a bit of tuning to support a 'fat-finger' mobile form factor, although this is just a simple matter of programming and is a very similar problem to ensuring the desktop app has a nice responsive design on small screen window sizes (similar to how the telegram desktop client handles it).  In the end, we focused on solving the Qt problem: building a custom Qt 5.9 for <a href="https://ubports.com">Ubports</a> (the community project who do a fantastic job of continuing Ubuntu Touch development since Canonical pulled out), while for simplicity building it on top of the current ubports distribution (which is effectively still Ubuntu 15.04).  The reason for all this Ubuntu stuff rather than using PureOS is simply that it's not far enough along, and we don't physically have a Librem5 dev kit yet to play with!

In practice, this has been a fascinating process: setting up a crosscompiler to build all of Qt5.9, and then porting the ubuntumirclient Qt Platform Abstraction to work with Qt5.9, as well as (finally) working out how to build a Qt5.9-compatible custom Maliit input context platform plugin to get the onscreen keyboard (OSK) up and running.  But we got there in the end, and it was rather fun to finally see the Nheko splash screen popping up on the Aquaris E5! :D

There was then a bit of a nightmare to get the OSK to work, thanks to<a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-46009"> https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-46009</a> causing the plugin to be silently not updated - but could then log in and the app worked great (albeit a bit slow thanks to being a debug build on the energy-efficient but slow Mediatek MT6582 SoC):
<div style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-2834" src="https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screenshot20170928_131924004-576x1024.png" alt="" width="288" height="512" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-2835" src="https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screenshot20170928_132210382-576x1024.png" alt="" width="288" height="512" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-2836" src="https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screenshot20170928_131057113-576x1024.png" alt="" width="288" height="512" /> <img class="size-large wp-image-2837" src="https://matrix.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screenshot20170928_132238278-576x1024.png" alt="" width="288" height="512" /></div>
Now the next step here would obviously be to tweak the app properly to layout on a phone (bigger fonts; bigger buttons; resize the window to make room for the OSK; separate the Left Panel from the timeline view; etc) - but the point here was more to show a fully fledged native Matrix client running on a current Linux Phone environment and see how it feels.  And we're happy to say that it leaves us dying to get our hands on a proper Librem5 so we can work with Nheko, uMatriks, libqmatrixclient and all the other native Matrix client projects to see how we can get the best possible native client experience running in PureOS for the phone!!

Finally, there doesn't seem to be much documentation out there on how to do a heavy customisation of Ubports like this, so for the sake of posterity, here's the guide if anyone else is crazy enough to try this (or for when Ubports gets around to doing an official update to Qt 5.9 for their OS!).  A versioned copy of this lives over at <a href="https://gist.github.com/ara4n/4a4076b8fd5a61153bde6c9a0a726c72">this gist</a>.

Thanks for reading, and don't forget to preorder!

<h3>Recipe: Librem5 experiments with an Ubuntu Phone and Nheko</h3>
Starting point: one old BQ Aquaris E5 ubuntu phone, running some old version of Ubuntu Touch which had got completely stuck (UI only unfreezing for 2-3 seconds every 2-3 minutes).

Step one: flash to latest UBPorts image:
<ul>
 	<li>Set up Ubuntu desktop as a host (as per <a href="https://docs.ubuntu.com/phone/en/devices/installing-ubuntu-for-devices">https://docs.ubuntu.com/phone/en/devices/installing-ubuntu-for-devices</a>)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-device-flash
sudo apt-get install phablet-tools
</code></pre>
<ul>
 	<li>Grab an adb-compatible recovery image (yes, seems like the right place is someone's personal webspace...)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>wget http://people.canonical.com/~jhm/barajas/recovery-vegetahd.img
</code></pre>
<ul>
 	<li>If your Ubuntu desktop is running in a VM, make sure you have USB 2.0 or 3.0 support enabled (in Virtualbox this needs the extension pack installed). USB 1 is too slow and the flash will timeout, semi-bricking the phone.</li>
 	<li>Press volume-up and power on the phone during boot to get at the bootloader. Make sure it's not plugged into USB</li>
 	<li>Select fastboot</li>
 	<li>Plug into USB</li>
 	<li>Flash the recovery image and latest UBPorts OS:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo ubuntu-device-flash --server=http://system-image.ubports.com touch --device=vegetahd \\
                         --channel=15.04/stable --bootstrap --recovery-image=recovery-vegetahd.img \\
                         --developer-mode --password=secret
</code></pre>
<ul>
 	<li>Ensure the system OS is writable. (Ubuntu Touch runs the OS partition read-only by default to protect users. In this case, you can always re-flash it if all goes wrong.)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>sudo phablet-config writable-image
</code></pre>
<ul>
 	<li>Get an SSH server running on the phone before you go insane</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>adb shell
sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start # password is as set when flashing.
</code></pre>
Step two: cross-compile latest Qt 5.9 for the phone.

Ubuntu 15.04 shipped with 5.4, which is pretty old now, and too old for nheko. Based on <a href="https://rm5248.com/cross-compile-qt-for-arm/">https://rm5248.com/cross-compile-qt-for-arm/</a>
<pre><code># grab the source for Qt5

# grab a copy of the root filesystem on the phone for the cross-compile to run against.

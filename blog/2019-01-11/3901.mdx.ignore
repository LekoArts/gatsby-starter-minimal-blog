<h2>Spec</h2>
Lots of spec work this week, and a shout out to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> for his magical <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@mscbot:matrix.org">mscbot </a>that provides pokes, nudges and updates on all things spec.

<h2>Dendrite</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a> had this to say:-
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dendrite audit is over! A bunch of issues have been created on the Dendrite GitHub repository, as well as a project board in order to keep track of everything: </span><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/projects/2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/projects/2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">There's a fair amount of issues that have been labeled as “good first issue”, so feel free to pick them up and open pull requests if you're looking into hacking on Dendrite! :)</span></blockquote>
And whilst we have your attention - here's Brendan &amp; Matthew talking through the audit in this week's Matrix Live!

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synapse</span></h3>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> says:-
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week saw the release of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.34.0.1">v0.34.0.1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.34.1.1">v0.34.1.1 </a></span><b>both contain critical security updates </b><b>so please update asap</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you have not already done so.

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matrix.org Foundation</span></h2>
Matthew has a final draft of the Matrix.org Foundation governance document ready: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1779/proposals/1779-open-governance.md">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1779/proposals/1779-open-governance.md</a>. Comments on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls/1779">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls/1779</a> would be much appreciated!  We expect to propose merging it next week, and then incorporating it into the final Articles of the foundation.
<h2>Riot Web</h2>
Loads and loads of work happening on <a href="https://riot.im/experimental">https://riot.im/experimental</a> which is now where all new development is happening as we race towards launching the new design.  Highlights include:
<ul>
 	<li>All new key verification is implemented! (in olm &amp; matrix-js-sdk).  We're currently hooking up the UX.</li>
 	<li>Online key backup is pretty much finished.</li>
 	<li>Cross-signing is up next.</li>
 	<li>Redesign backlog is progressing (slightly stuck on making the RoomList resizing work nicely, but almost there)</li>
 	<li>Finalising the all new registration/login screens</li>
 	<li>...and loads of other stuff too.</li>
</ul>

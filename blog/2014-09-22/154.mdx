Hello world,

Synapse 0.3.3 was released today, concentrating on both feature & stability improvements on the webclient.  The big news is that 1:1 video calling via WebRTC is implemented (although we're still working on some stability issues, and Synapse doesn't support TURN yet.  This will be coming in the next few days however!).

Play with the demo server at http://matrix.org/alpha, or update your own homeserver with a <code>git pull && ./synctl restart</code> or by cloning a new checkout with <code>git clone https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse.git</code>

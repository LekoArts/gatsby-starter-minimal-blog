<h3>Matrix Live S3E11</h3>
This week I chatted with Jason Robinson about all things decentralisation, especially his projects <a href="https://github.com/jaywink/socialhome">socialhome</a>, <a href="https://the-federation.info/">the-federation.info</a>, and <a href="https://feneas.org">feneas.org</a>. Jason has been interested in decentralisation for many years, and had a lot to say about how we can look forward to a more decentralised Internet.

<blockquote>It's a New Year and there have been a lot of improvements to the <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> playbook:
<ul>
 	<li>there's now support for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/docs/importing-postgres.md">importing an existing Postgres database</a>, which should make it easier for people with another setup to migrate over.</li>
 	<li>there's now support for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/docs/configuring-playbook-ssl-certificates.md">manually-managed and self-signed certificates</a>, in addition to the Let's Encrypt support we've always had</li>
 	<li>the playbook now uses a much better (20x smaller, faster) riot-web Docker image (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/avhost/docker-matrix-riot/">avhost/docker-matrix-riot</a> -&gt; <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bubuntux/riot-web/">bubuntux/riot-web</a>). At least until <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/pull/7771">vector-im/riot-web#7771</a> gets merged and official images become available.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-mxisd-configuration-changes">completely redone</a> way of generating mxisd configuration, letting people unleash the full power of mxisd without us having to explicitly add support for new features</li>
 	<li>mxisd 1.3.0-ready. We default to a stable mxisd release still (1.2.2), but people can try the much-improved 1.3.0 alpha releases even now (e.g. <code>matrix_mxisd_docker_image: "kamax/mxisd:1.3.0-alpha.2"</code>).</li>
 	<li>we now utilize <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/blob/4185b644b7b69af36bb1fdc81976a36590b1b97f/docs/features/directory.md">mxisd's User Directory Search feature</a> to augment the results coming from Synapse</li>
 	<li>the playbook has been <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#splitting-the-playbook-into-multiple-roles">split into multiple roles</a> (one role per component) and the <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/fef6c052c34404a15985a87ad9593596c349cd04/CHANGELOG.md#bc-break-making-the-playbooks-roles-more-independent-of-one-another">roles have been made independent of one another</a>. People who want to re-use our roles in their own playbooks can now more-easily do so.</li>
 	<li>even more components have become optional and can now be turned off completely (coturn, mailer)</li>
</ul>
Lots of thanks go to Maximus, jcgruenhage and Cadair for helping out!</blockquote>
<h3>libQMatrixClient and Quaternion</h3>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!FPUfgzXYWTKgIrwKxW:matrix.org/$1547372159502087lVDqI:matrix.org">reports that</a>:
<blockquote>libQMatrixClient 0.4.2 has been released, fixing a security issue (the library could be tricked into altering the local room state by fake state events - those without state_key). The master branch of the library is updated as well - it is strongly recommended to update to either 0.4.2 or master, depending on which branch you live on.</blockquote><br /><blockquote>For those who want to help testing Quaternion or just can't wait to the next release, we now have CI builds collected at bintray: <a href="https://bintray.com/qmatrixclient/ci/Quaternion">https://bintray.com/qmatrixclient/ci/Quaternion</a>. Linux and macOS are already there, and Windows binaries will also be available any day soon.</blockquote>

<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-slack">matrix-puppet-slack v1.10.0</a> has been released, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Cadair">Cadair</a> and (once again!) <a href="https://github.com/d3m3vilurr">d3m3vilurr</a>!<br /><br />v1.10.0 fixes Matrix-to-Slack image upload, and no longer sends markdown-formatted @-mention links in the plaintext body of Matrix events; instead, it uses plaintext username the way text-only clients traditionally have it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The version bump is also the project's 100th commit, and I've updated the supported feature checklist in the README to paint a more comprehensive picture of what is and isn't supported, and link out to the GitHub Issues for some of the unsupported features, in hopes of making life easier for users and encouraging contributions.</blockquote>

<blockquote><a href="https://opsdroid.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">opsdroid</a>'s Matrix connector is now a core part of the library rather than an external addition. This should open up a lot of cool possibilities for doing fancy stuff with bots on matrix. Many thanks to Cadair for helping with this.</blockquote>

<blockquote>made some minor changes to <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop">continuum</a> to make the GUI more intuitive.

It should also make it easier to add more fancy stuff like html tables and selecting messages (for replying/redacting)</blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riot iOS</span></h3>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are still working on the key backup screens. The last bit on the SDK side, the passphrase support, has been implemented this week.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reskin is almost done. It just needs some small adjustments. We will release a beta soon so that we can gather users feedback.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, we have also fixed small but boring UX issues in Riot and we will continue to do so up to the end of the month and FOSDEM!</span></blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riot Android</span></h3>
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reskin is almost done too and available on develop builds.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benoit has started to implement the key backup passphrase management in the SDK. Valere is still improving push notifications at the code level but also at the display level.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are working hard to polish the app for FOSDEM.</span></blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modular</span></h3>
Rick reports:
<blockquote><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now have a</span><b> HipChat migration tool - </b><a href="https://www.modular.im/tools/hipchat-migration"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.modular.im/tools/hipchat-migration</span></a><b>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tool helps migrate a HipChat workspace to your very own Modular Hosted Homeserver. Migration is performed by uploading an exported copy of an existing HipChat workspace so that the tool can automatically re-create all of the users and rooms (including messages and attachments) on your new Matrix homeserver. Once the migration is complete all of the migrated users will be emailed with login instructions, so that they can seamlessly continue chatting where they left off in HipChat. If your organisation (or if you know of an organisation that) has not yet decided what to do when Stride &amp; HipChat is discontinued next month, come and try Modular!</span></blockquote>

Hi!

I’m Ankush, and if we don’t know each other very well, this section is a decent place to start. I am 25 yr old business grad working as a PM in a SaaS company. I hail from a small town in Uttar Pradesh, India and I started working in IT industry almost half a decade back.
I am an avid newsletter reader (idk why, but I seem not to read that many books) and whenever I am not working you will find me exploring nature or simply just travelling and enjoying local cuisines.
I love exploring new ideas, new food and places and I really love to talk about all of this. Now that you know a bit about me and you have read so far, I would love to know about you as well.
Why don’t you simply drop a “Hey” on my LinkedIn and I would get in touch with you.
